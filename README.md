Initial Setup and Data Exploration
Project Setup: Created the initial setup for the project, including importing necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.
Data Loading: Loaded the dataset from the provided CSV file and displayed the shape and first few rows of the dataset for initial inspection.
Missing Values Analysis
Missing Values Identification: Identified features with missing values and calculated the percentage of missing values for each feature.
Visualization: Plotted bar charts to visualize the relationship between missing values in features and the SalePrice.
Numerical Features Analysis
Identification: Listed all numerical features and displayed their top 5 records.
Year Features Analysis: Identified features related to year information and plotted the median SalePrice against the year sold.
Temporal Variables: Analyzed the difference between year-related features and the year the house was sold, visualized using scatter plots.
Discrete and Continuous Variables Analysis
Discrete Variables: Identified discrete numerical features, visualized their relationship with SalePrice using bar charts.
Continuous Variables: Identified continuous numerical features, plotted histograms to understand their distribution.
Logarithmic Transformation
Transformation: Applied logarithmic transformation to continuous numerical features (excluding zero values) and plotted scatter plots to show the relationship with SalePrice.
Categorical Features Analysis
Identification: Listed categorical features and displayed the first few records.
Visualization: Plotted bar charts to visualize the relationship between categorical features and SalePrice.
Improvements and Fixes
Code Organization: Improved the organization and readability of the code with better comments and structure.
File Saving: Removed redundant plt.savefig() calls. Ensured plots are displayed correctly.
Feature Check Correction: Corrected the check for missing values in features to display accurate results.
Log Transformation: Ensured features with zero values are skipped to avoid log(0) errors.
Categorical Feature Analysis: Fixed dtype check for categorical features and provided a clear relationship analysis with SalePrice.
Future Updates
Model Building: Plan to add sections for feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.
Interactive Plots: Consider implementing interactive visualizations using libraries like Plotly for better data exploration.
Notes
This project is aimed at performing comprehensive data exploration and visualization to understand the dataset better before moving on to feature engineering and model building phases. The current edits ensure the initial setup, data loading, and exploratory data analysis are thorough and correctly implemented.

This section should help other developers understand the progression of the project, the specific changes made, and the reasons behind these changes.
